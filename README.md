## introduction
This code is made for an activity. Maybe it's a little bit sensitive about politics. 
But here we just talk about the technique of code. 
I am a Chinese and I know what I can do.
Sorry to tell that I am a **freshman** for html but always on the way.
Yeah, to be honest I haven't learnt more about CSS.
However, I can't wait to use the wonderful language to express my art.

## details
### head
Nothing to mention more but the "p-silk" is absolute to the "body", I don't know why but it works by practice.
### navigation
The layout of five stars is interesting, as well as the function. As you can see I haven't learnt about JS.
The instruction from Xi is linked.
### main body
**left**
It is made up of three parts. The sentences is linked. The last part you can type in words.
**right**
Some decorations are not made by UI but by using html to put them well.
Some words or paragraph are linked.
### foot
Nothing to mention.
